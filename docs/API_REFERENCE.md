# API Reference

Complete REST API reference for the Samridhi Enterprises backend.

All endpoints are mounted under the `/api` prefix by the Express server
(`server/index.js`). In local development the base URL is:

```
http://localhost:5000/api
```

In production it is the deployed server origin followed by `/api`.

---

## Authentication

The API uses **stateless JWT authentication**.

1. A user registers (`POST /api/user/register`) and verifies their email with a
   one-time password (`POST /api/user/verify-email`).
2. On a successful login (`POST /api/user/login`) the API returns a JWT in the
   JSON body (it is also set as an `httpOnly` cookie):

   ```json
   { "success": true, "user": { ... }, "token": "<JWT>", "verifyEmail": true }
   ```

3. For every protected request the client sends that token in the
   `Authorization` header:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
   ```

The token payload is `{ id, role }` and is signed with `JWT_SECRET`, expiring
after `JWT_EXPIRE`. The `auth` middleware (`server/middleware/auth.js`) reads
the token from the `Authorization` header only — not from the cookie — so the
header must be set on protected requests.

### Access levels

| Symbol | Meaning | Middleware |
|--------|---------|------------|
| 🔓 | Public — no token required | none |
| 🔒 | Authenticated — any logged-in user | `auth` |
| 🛡️ | Admin/Manager only (`role` is `ADMIN` or `MANAGER`) | `auth` + `admin` |

A 🔒 request with a missing/invalid token returns `401`
`{ "success": false, "message": "Please login again" }` (or
`"Token expired, please login again"` for an expired/invalid JWT). A 🛡️ request
from a non-admin returns `401`
`{ "success": false, "message": "Not Authorized Login Again" }`.

File-upload endpoints accept `multipart/form-data` (handled by `multer`); all
other request bodies are JSON.
