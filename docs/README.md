## Where other topics live

Setup and operational guides already live in the repository root and are **not**
duplicated here:

- **Project overview, features, tech stack, folder structure** → [`README.md`](../README.md)
- **Local development setup** (prerequisites, backend & frontend) → [`README.md`](../README.md)
- **MongoDB Atlas / Cloudinary / Brevo setup** → [`README.md`](../README.md)
- **Deployment guide** → [`README.md`](../README.md#-deployment-guide)
- **Contributor guidelines, branch strategy, commit & PR conventions** → [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](../CONTRIBUTING.md)
- **Code of conduct** → [`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`](../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)

## How to keep these docs accurate

These references are derived directly from the source. When a change touches the
API, models, env vars, or an admin capability, update the matching document in
the **same pull request** so the docs never drift from the code.
