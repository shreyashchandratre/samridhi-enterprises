// Rule-based customer support assistant — conversational decision tree.
//
// This file is the single source of truth for every flow the assistant can
// walk a user through. It contains NO logic and NO UI — just data — so new
// topics, questions, and answers can be added or edited here without touching
// the component. To add a topic: add a node keyed by a unique id, give it a
// `message`, and a list of `options` whose `next` points at another node id
// (or use `action` for a terminal step like escalation).
//
// Node shape:
//   {
//     message: string            // what the assistant says at this step
//     options?: [                // buttons the user can tap
//       { label: string, next?: string, action?: string, href?: string }
//     ]
//   }
//
// Reserved node id: "root" is always where a conversation (re)starts.
// Reserved actions: "restart" returns to root; "escalate" surfaces the
// contact options. Anything else is treated as a normal navigation via `next`.
